  "story": "I am a self-taught game developer with over 7 years of experience, specializing in Unity. My journey began at 13 with GameMaker, and I quickly transitioned to Unity to explore diverse game development techniques. At 19, I briefly studied Game Programming (B.Sc.) at SRH University but exceeded the curriculum's scope. Shortly after, I joined Thera Bytes, contributing to the development and maintenance of Global Farmer ahead of and after its Early Access release.",
  "philosophy": "I prioritize clean, efficient, and collaborative code, aiming to make life easier for both colleagues and my future self. My focus is on delivering great games, so I avoid reinventing the wheel and strive to keep complex game systems—like combat or dialogue—well-organized and easy to manage. With a structured and analytical mindset, I leverage clear naming conventions, folder organization, and a data-oriented approach to streamline development and handle large codebases effectively.",
  "interests": "For the past 5 years, calisthenics has been a core part of my lifestyle, combining my love for movement, the outdoors, and social connections. I also enjoy bouldering and chess, blending physical and mental challenges. On the nerdier side, I’m passionate about Jungle/DnB music and have a deep nostalgia for the PS2 and early 2000s PC gaming era. "
