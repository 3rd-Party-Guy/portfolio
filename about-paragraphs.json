  "story": "I am a 20-year-old self-taught game developer. My game-dev journey started at 13 years old, using GameMaker. I quickly transitioned to Unity, and have been exploring all different kinds of ways to create games since. When I was 19 I went to SRH University to study Game Programming (B.Sc.), but I was quickly told that my knowledge already surpassed the curriculum. Then I quickly found Thera Bytes, where I helped with the development of Global Farmer prior to their Early Access release, and then helped with the maintenance of the project.",
  "philosophy": "When programming, I try to be as nice as possible. Both to all my colleagues and to my future self. Writing simple code that does not reinvent the wheel is the way to go for me. What matters for me is the game that comes out in the end. And since games are very complicated codebases,so I try to keep each topic - topics being an ongoing subject in the game, like combat, or dialogue - as separated and simple to communicate with as possible.I am also a very structured and analytical person, so while I know that everything can be a double-edged sword, I tend to use structure (naming conventions, folder structures) to simplify the development. This goes hand-in-hand with my data-oriented approach to game-development.",
  "interests": "I have been training calisthenics for the last 5 years and it has become an integral part of my lifestyle. I love going outside, moving, and being social. The social aspect of training is something integral to my life. Other than that I also enjoy bouldering and chess. Onto my more nerdy interests, I really love Jungle/DnB music, and have a special place in my heart for the PS2/2000s PC gaming era. "
